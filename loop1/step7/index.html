<div class="test"><span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone in the opposite <br>sex is something that runs deeply within everyone, even<br>though most people don't take the time to find someone <br>who truly respect them. It seems like people are just <br>looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention,settling for something much than respect. I<br> am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</div>

<div class="text2">
  I have come to the the conclusion that evryone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone<br> extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
